In this project, I learned how a website is created from the basics. I started with **HTML**, where I understood how to structure a webpage using different tags and elements. Then I learned **CSS**, which helped me make the page look better by adding colors, layouts, and styles. After that, I explored **JavaScript**, which made the website more interactive and dynamic.

Apart from coding, I also learned how to use **Git and GitHub** properly. I practiced forking repositories, creating new branches for every task, committing my changes, and making pull requests. This helped me understand how developers manage their code and work together in real projects.

Doing each issue step by step taught me how to solve problems, look for solutions online, and document what I learned. It also improved my confidence in using developer tools and writing clean code. Overall, this project gave me a strong foundation in web development and real-world teamwork.
