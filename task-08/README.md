About Backend what i learnt:-

In this task, I learned about the backend of an application the part that works behind the scenes like the brain or engine of the system. While the frontend is what users see and interact with, the backend is what actually makes everything run. It handles the data, logic, and communication that keep the whole app functioning properly.

I explored Flask, a lightweight and flexible Python web framework that’s used to build backends. I found it interesting how Flask helps set up the main structure of a web app and makes it easy to define routes, handle requests, and connect to databases. Even though it’s simple to learn, it’s powerful enough for creating large and complex applications.

One of the most exciting parts for me was learning about RESTful APIs. I understood that APIs act like messengers between the frontend and backend. For example, when a user performs an action on a website — like creating an account, submitting data, or checking details the frontend sends a request to the API, which then interacts with the backend and sends the right response back.
I also learned about the main REST methods GET for retrieving data, POST for creating new entries, PUT for updating, and DELETE for removing data. This organized structure makes data handling clean, efficient, and easy to maintain.

I also came to understand how application logic fits into the backend. It controls how data is processed, manages authentication (like login and user sessions), and ensures that everything runs securely and smoothly.

Overall, this task gave me a clear picture of how the backend supports the entire app. Even though I haven’t implemented it yet, I now understand how Flask and RESTful APIs work together to handle data and communication. It was really interesting to see how all the behind-the-scenes parts come together to make an app function properly
