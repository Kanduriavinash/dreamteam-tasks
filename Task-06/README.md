-----------------------------------------Fable_PT----------------------------------------------

Project Overview:

Fable_PT is a design prototype I worked on to create a clean, modern interface with smooth and intuitive interactions. My main goal was to build something visually appealing but also easy to use. Throughout the project, I focused on clean layouts, consistent typography, reusable components, and interactive navigation to make the experience feel natural and engaging.

Objectives & Goals:

Intuitive User Flow: I wanted users to navigate easily between screens without confusion.
Visual Consistency: Fonts, spacing, and colors were kept uniform across all frames to make the design feel polished.
Reusable Components: Buttons, cards, and headers were created to be used across multiple screens, saving time and keeping things consistent.
Interactive Prototype: I added clickable buttons and scroll-based transitions to make it feel more like a real app.

Design Approach:

Here’s how I approached the design:
Component-Based Layouts: Reusable components allowed me to make changes globally, keeping everything consistent.
Smooth Navigation: I linked screens in Figma’s prototype mode, using clicks and scroll/drag triggers for a more dynamic feel.
Balanced Layouts: I made sure alignment, spacing, and hierarchy were consistent so each screen felt organized.

Screens & Flow:

Home / Landing Frame: The first frame features the hero section, introduction, and main call-to-action.
Content Frames: Additional frames show detailed content, features, or secondary information.
Back Navigation: Users can easily return to previous screens to avoid getting lost.
Interactive Experience: Scroll and click triggers make the flow smooth and engaging.

--->
Gained hands-on experience with Figma’s Prototype mode.
Improved workflow for building reusable components and keeping layouts consistent.
Next steps include responsive variants, mobile views, and more advanced transitions like overlays and nested flows.
