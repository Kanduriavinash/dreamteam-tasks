Created a functions.py file for writting all the functions and tested all the functions by creating another file test_functions.py using assert(assert is used to check if the result of a function is correct or not.If it's correct, the test passes; if it's wrong, the test fails.).

test_function.py()

Output:-

LEVEL-01

test_schoolBounty.py()

I created two files: location_map.py and test_geo_map.py.
 The location_geo_map.py file has two functions - one that finds our location using an IP address and API (showing details like latitude, longitude, city, region, and country), and another that uses the folium library to create a map from those coordinates and saves it as an HTML file that we can open and view.
 
test_geo_map.py()

Output:-

Here I build a model or an app that gets live weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. To make sure it works correctly, I wrote unit tests using pytest and used mocking to test it without real API calls. All tests passed, showing that the app handles data and errors properly.

weather_app.py()

test_weather_app.py()

Output:-
